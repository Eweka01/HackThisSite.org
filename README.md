I first started working on these missions in 2022 and revisited them in 2024 with a stronger emphasis on grasping the fundamental concepts. Although some challenges may seem a bit outdated, having been designed in the early 2000s, they remain a solid introduction to hacking basics and web security. The missions illustrate how web technologies and security flaws have changed over time, making them valuable for learning foundational ideas that are still relevant today.
