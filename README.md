I started working through these missions in 2022 before returning to them in
2024 and really trying to understand the concepts. The missions now are a bit
dated – they were originally created in the early 2000s – but it's not hard
to think about how concepts and web technologies have changed since then. So,
I think these missions were still useful to learn basic ideas behind hacking
and web security.
